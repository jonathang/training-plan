=============

Displays training plan for Half-Marathon using the FIRST training plan.

# What is it for ?
The Furman FIRST training plan from [Furman University](http://www.furmanfirst.com/) is well described in 
Runner's World book [Run Less Run Faster]: (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159486649X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=159486649X&linkCode=as2&tag=stephasthough-20).

Basically, it is a simple 16-week program with moderate running sessions that try to emphasize a 3+2 approach: 3 run sessions and 2 cross-training sessions. Each run session is called 'key run' and there are 3 different key runs:
* key run 1 - track repeats to improve economy, running speed and vo2 max
* key run 2 - tempo run paces to improve lactate tolerances
* key run 3 - long run paces to improve skeletal and cardiac muscle adaptation


# What problem does it solve ?
It can be a bit time-consuming to look in the charts and get an entire plan laid out, so
this small script is intended to be a starting point and get a quick overview of it.

# Under construction
This needs some serious clean up and ideally, this would be enhanced to support the 5K, 10K, half-marathon and marathons training programs and export all the workout as TCX data to be able to be imported in Garmin Training Center (assuming it can do so). It would be helpful if Garmin Connect
was supporting workout import too at some point. For now how to interact with both and the Garmin Agent is a bit in the nebulous side.


# How to run it
I'm still working on out, but the script is straightforward to use right now.
